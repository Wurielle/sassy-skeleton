Sassy Skeleton is an unofficial SASS (and not SCSS)  version of [Dave Gamache's](https://twitter.com/dhg) Skeleton Framework. It currently features a stable version of Skeleton 2.0.4.

Check out <http://getskeleton.com> for the original documentation and details.

## Getting started

### What's in the download?

The download includes Sassy Skeleton's SASS, Skeleton's CSS (2.0.4), Normalize CSS as a reset, ~~a sample favicon,~~ and an index.html as a starting point.

### Why it's awesome

Skeleton is lightweight and simple. It styles only raw HTML elements (with a few exceptions) and provides a responsive grid. Nothing more.
- Around 400 lines of CSS unminified and with comments (TODO)
- It's a starting point, not a UI framework
- No compiling or installing...just vanilla CSS (TODO)


## Browser support

- Chrome latest
- Firefox latest
- Opera latest
- Safari latest
- IE latest

The above list is non-exhaustive. Skeleton works perfectly with almost all older versions of the browsers above, though IE certainly has large degradation prior to IE9.

## Extensions

The following are extensions to Skeleton built by the community. They are not officially supported, but all have been tested and are compatible with v2.0 (exact release noted):
- [Skeleton on LESS](https://github.com/whatsnewsaes/Skeleton-less): Skeleton built with LESS for easier replacement of grid, color, and media queries. (Last update was to match v2.0.1)
- [Skeleton on Sass](https://github.com/whatsnewsaes/Skeleton-Sass): Skeleton built with Sass for easier replacement of grid, color, and media queries. (Last update was to match v2.0.1)


## Colophon

Skeleton was built using [Sublime Text 3](http://www.sublimetext.com/3) and designed with [Sketch](http://bohemiancoding.com/sketch). The typeface [Raleway](http://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Raleway) was created by [Matt McInerney](http://matt.cc/) and [Pablo Impallari](http://www.impallari.com/).
